function x = pagerank(G,p)
% PAGERANK  Google's PageRank
% pagerank(U,G,p) uses the URLs and adjacency matrix produced by SURFER,
% together with a damping factory p, (default is .85), to compute and plot
% a bar graph of page rank, and print the dominant URLs in page rank order.
% x = pagerank(U,G,p) returns the page ranks instead of printing.
% See also SURFER, SPY.
